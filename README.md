Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Developed an interactive web-based application to visually demonstrate the workings of various sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Selection Sort etc. This tool allows users to:

• Visualize step-by-step sorting processes with dynamically generated bars representing the data being sorted.<br />
• Visualization and choose between different algorithms.<br />
• User-friendly interface designed using HTML and CSS, providing a clean and intuitive layout.<br />
• JavaScript handles the logic behind each algorithm, enabling real-time updates and animations.<br />

The project enhances the understanding of sorting algorithms by providing clear visual feedback and is designed to be responsive and lightweight for optimal performance.<br />
